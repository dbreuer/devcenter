<h2>What is an Organization on Bitrise?</h2>
<p>Organizations are used to seamlessly manage bigger teams and members inside a company.
It is a place to gather all the people working on each of your company's
apps and delegate them through creating different groups.</p>
<h2>How do I create a new Organization?</h2>
<p>Just go to your <a href="https://www.bitrise.io/me/profile#/overview">account settings page</a>,
scroll down and click on the green <code>New organization</code> button at the bottom left.
A popup will appear to guide you through the process.</p>
<h2>How do I add an app to an Organization?</h2>
<p>First, you have to be added to at least one <code>Group</code> of the Organization.
Then, go to the <a href="https://www.bitrise.io/apps/add">Add new app page</a> and select
the Organization in the <strong>dropdown at the top left</strong>.</p>
<p>You can change this throughout the process of adding the app, or after you finished adding the app,
changing the owner is possible through <a href="/faq/how-to-change-the-owner-of-an-app/">transferring ownership</a>.</p>
<h2>How do I migrate/transfer my existing apps to an Organization?</h2>
<p>Once you've created an Organization, you can transfer any of your apps to it by going to
the <code>Team</code> tab of the app you want to transfer, and clicking the <strong>Transfer ownership</strong> button at the top right.</p>
<h2>What are &quot;Owners&quot; inside an Organization?</h2>
<p>Organizations can have more than one Owner.
Owners can <strong>manage billing</strong>, <strong>delete apps</strong> and <strong>change the billing email</strong>,
create, delete and assign <strong>groups</strong> to apps.</p>
<h2>What can &quot;Members&quot; of an Organization do?</h2>
<p>Members are displayed on the <strong>People</strong> tab of the Organization's page.
One can be added as a member by including them in a group on the <strong>Groups</strong> tab.
These members have the option to add apps to the Organization and view a list of all of the
Organization's apps on the <strong>Apps</strong> tab.
Members can only access an Organization's app, if they are granted access to the app directly or through a <code>Group</code>,
in respect of their assigned role (Admin, Developer or Tester).</p>
<h2>What are groups good for?</h2>
<p>A group is basically a wrapper for members. By creating groups, Owners and Admins can
add multiple members to each app's team at once, making it faster and easier to setup new
projects on Bitrise. It also make it faster to reassign, remove and change role of multiple members.</p>
<p>Each group is handled as one entity on the app's <code>Team</code> tab. They can be added to an app's team,
the group's role can be set, and by removing the Group from the app's Team
you can revoke the access of every member of that group from the app.
It's not possible however to add or delete individual members of a group there, only on the Org's page.</p>
<p><em>All members of a group have the same role when assigned to an app.</em></p>
<h2>What's the difference between a Team and an Organization?</h2>
<p>Teams are handled per app, Organizations are handled globally.</p>
<p>A Team of an Organization's app can contain members invited directly
or through the groups assigned to them. Team members with a direct role
can only access the app they were invited to and can't add an app to the Organization.
Members of a Team always have a role assigned to them (Admin, Developer or Tester).</p>
<h2>Who are the &quot;outside contributors&quot;?</h2>
<p>Outside contributors are members of an app's Team with a direct role,
invited only to an app of an Organization and not to the Organization itself.</p>
<h2>Can I have multiple Organizations?</h2>
<p>One user can have as many Organizations as they like, but each Organization has to have
an active Pro subscription to be able to run builds.</p>
<h2>Can I have multiple Pro subscriptions?</h2>
<p>Yes. Each account can subscribe to Pro for their personal account and for as many Organizations as needed.</p>
<h2>What if I cancel my Pro plan for an Organization?</h2>
<p>After the Pro plan expires, builds can't be started for apps owned by the Organization.</p>
<h2>Can I remove someone from all of my Organization's apps?</h2>
<p>If you are an Owner of an Organization, you can remove members and outside contributors
on the Org's <code>People</code> tab, with one click. Owners can also remove someone from a group
on the <code>Groups</code> tab. In this case the user will be removed from all apps' team that the group is assigned to.</p>
<h2>Where can I change the avatar for my Organization?</h2>
<p>Once you are on your Organization page, click on the avatar, and you'll see a popup
to change the color scheme of it. We'll add custom avatar support a bit later.</p>
