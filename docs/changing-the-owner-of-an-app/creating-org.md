<p>You can create and manage <strong>Organizations</strong> on <a href="https://www.bitrise.io">bitrise.io</a> to manage entire teams quickly and effectively. You can set up multiple groups within an organization for different projects - for example, you can have a <em>Developer</em> group and a <em>Tester</em> group assigned to different app. You can also set roles for your group: these roles determine the access rights provided to members of the group.</p>
<p>To run builds as an organization, you need to subscribe to an <strong>Organization</strong> plan.</p>
<h2>Creating an organization</h2>
<p>No need for lengthy preparation when you wish to create an organization on Bitrise: all you really need is an existing Bitrise account - this will be the default owner of the organization - and an organization name. You can set up everything else later!</p>
