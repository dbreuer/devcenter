<p>It can happen that you need to transfer an Application on <a href="https://www.bitrise.io">Bitrise</a>
to another User or to an Organization.
This can be done in a few seconds by following these quick steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Login with the <strong>current Owner</strong> of the App on <a href="https://www.bitrise.io">bitrise.io</a></li>
<li>Open the App's page and go to the <code>Team</code> tab</li>
<li>Make sure the new owner of the App is in the team or add her/him if you need to.
In case if you want to transfer the ownership to an Organization,
you have to be part of the Organization.</li>
<li>Click the <code>Transfer ownership</code> button next to your name</li>
<li>After selecting the new owner from the dropdown, click on the purple button that says
<code>Transfer ownership to &lt;Username&gt;</code>, and you are done!</li>
</ol>
<p>!!! note &quot;Good to know: Do you want to remain the connected services user?&quot;
If you enable the <code>Do you want to remain the connected services user?</code> option in the Transfer popup,
then during the transfer you'll be explicitly marked as the &quot;connected services&quot; user for the app.</p>
<pre><code>The &quot;connected services&quot; user specifies which Team Member's service connections / accounts
connected to his/her Bitrise user should be used when Bitrise tries to communicate
with another service (GitHub, Bitbucket, ...), for example to send back build status information,
or to register a new SSH key automatically.

Admins of an app can change this any time on the `Settings` tab of the app.</code></pre>
