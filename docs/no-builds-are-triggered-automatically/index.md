<p>If no builds are triggered automatically when you push code into your repository,
you should <strong>make sure your webhook is properly set on the git hosting
service you use (GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, ...)</strong>.</p>
<p>You can find the webhook related setup and troubleshooting guides
in the <a href="/webhooks/">Webhooks section of the DevCenter</a>.</p>
<p>If the webhook is present on the git hosting service, you should
check the <a href="/webhooks/troubleshooting">Troubleshooting section of the Webhooks docs</a>.</p>
