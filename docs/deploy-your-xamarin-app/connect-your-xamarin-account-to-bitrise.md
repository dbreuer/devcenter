<p>A connected Xamarin account is required if you use Xamarin Components
for example, which requires Xamarin authentication.</p>
<p>To connect your Xamarin account to your Bitrise.io account,
open your <a href="https://www.bitrise.io/me/profile#/overview">Account Settings page on bitrise.io</a>,
and click the toggle in the left sidebar where you see <code>Xamarin</code>.</p>
<p>Here you can type in your username and password.
Please note that <strong>we won't store your username or password</strong>,
we send an authentication request with these information to the Xamarin
server and store only the returned authentication token.</p>
<p><em>If you'd want to remove the connection just turn off the toggle.</em></p>
