<p>Do you require a VPN connection for your build, to be able to connect to your server,
either to <code>git clone</code> your repository or to access a private API?
If yes, then this tutorial is for you!</p>
<h2>Technical infos</h2>
<p>Connecting to a VPN, in short, works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>the build starts</li>
<li>you install &amp; configure the VPN components you need</li>
<li>you start the VPN</li>
<li>you proceed with the build</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously, if you require a VPN connection in order to access your code repository,
you have to connect to the VPN <strong>before</strong> the <code>Git Clone</code> step, but in general
you can configure &amp; connect to the VPN anywhere in your Workflow, <strong>before</strong> you'd use the
connection.</p>
<p><em>You can choose other VPN tools, not just the one shown here (<a href="https://www.strongswan.org">strongswan</a>),
this is just one example setup which works on <a href="https://www.bitrise.io">bitrise.io</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>One important note</strong>: when you choose your VPN tool and do the setup/configuration,
you have to be careful to <strong>not to restart / abort</strong> existing SSH sessions!
The <a href="https://www.bitrise.io">bitrise.io</a> workers will abort the build
if the SSH connection between the build's Control/Master machine and
the Build virtual machine terminates!</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>This is an example script which you can either save into your repository and run
it from there, or just copy paste its content into a <code>Script Step</code> in your <code>bitrise</code>
configuration (<code>bitrise.yml</code> / Workflow).</p>
